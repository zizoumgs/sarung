Sarung is web application which dedicate to Pondok Pesantren Fatihul Ulum Scholl . We decide to make it since there are no application which is very close to 
What they need. 
Sarung aims to become total documentation for Fatihul Ulum Both school and Pesantren . 
Laravel aims to make the development process a pleasing one for the developer without sacrificing application functionality. Happy developers make the best code. To this end, we've attempted to combine the very best of what we have seen in other web frameworks, including frameworks implemented in other languages, such as Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC, and Sinatra.

## Hosting
